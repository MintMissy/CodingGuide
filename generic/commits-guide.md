# Commit Messages Guideline

Each commit should be prefixed with special prefix that indicates made changes. This guideline is based on [FreeCodeCamp Post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/)

## Code Related

`feat` – a new feature is introduced with the changes

`fix` – a bug fix has occurred

`perf` – performance improvements

`test` – including new or correcting previous tests

`ci` – continuous integration related

`revert` – reverts a previous commit

## Dependencies Related

`build` – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies

`chore` – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or "test" files (for example updating dependencies)

## Code Quality

`refactor` – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

`style` – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to "code" formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.

`docs` – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
